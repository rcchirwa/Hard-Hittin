This code is part of an on going venture i.e. site creating a Web Application  for an individual in the entertainment industry who agreed for me to open source(place on github) any work related to the site. 

Version 1: The First Waltz

This contains code that was written during my first year of using open source technology to create web applications.  Prior to that, I used proprietary stacks such as one current provided by Oracle. 

The primary noteworthy features used here are as follows:

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- Backbone.js
- JSON

- Python
- Google App Engine

This is raw code that is not structured and was part of my sandbox aka evolving project. This code was last worked on in October 2012 proir to working a full position that involved Data Enginering and the use of Ruby as a scripting/object-oriented tool.
