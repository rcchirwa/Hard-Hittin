This code is part of an on going venture i.e. site creating a Web Application  for an individual in the entertainment industry who agreed for me to open source(place on github) any work related to the site. 

Version 1: The First Waltz (Tag v0.0.1)
-----------------------------------------------

This contains code that was written during my first year of using open source technology to create web applications.  Prior to that, I used proprietary stacks such as one current provided by Oracle. 

The primary noteworthy technologies used here are as follows:


Front End:

	HTML5
	CSS3
	LESS CSS
	JavaScript
	Backbone.js
	Underscore.js
	JQuery
	JSON


Back End:

	Python
	Google App Engine
	Jinja Templating

This is raw code that is not structured and was part of my sandbox aka evolving project. This code was last worked on in October 2012 prior to working a full position that involved Data Engineering and the use of Ruby as a scripting/object-oriented tool. 

The dirty version of the site is currently viewable at the following location: http://www.pranacoding.appspot.com

 2: The Revisit   (Tag v0.0.2)
----------------------------------


This version contains code that I revisited after a 4 month stint that lasted from 10/2012 â€“ 02/2013. As mentioned in the previous description the role related to data engineering and working primarily with Ruby, SQL, Extract Transform and Load (ETL), Postgres and AWS S3.  The position required no web application engineering knowledge. However, I was working on a work-related passion side project that involved ultimately using Ruby on Rails. 

After the conclusion of the aforementioned position, I went back to working with Python and engaging Web Application engineering. It was also time to sharpen and refine my skills so I revisited Code school (Public profile accessible at,  http://www.codeschool.com/users/rcchirwa ) to go over courses that I had completed last (2012) spring and summer prior to the Ruby Bits Module to recalibarate myself from a Data Engineer to a Web Application Engineer.

I used the information acquired above as well as the rekindled knowledge to revisit the project. The difference between the first commit and this commit is to show the maturation and evolution of my Front End Engineering skills.

Major Differences: 
	- restructured a lot of the HTML code to incorporate more HTML5 tags and structures
	- refined the CSS3 for the project after gaining a better grasp on various related concepts.   
	- Responsive/Adaptive Web Design added to it to the sit look different on a mobile device or changes when you resize the browser.
	- The functionality of the Tweeter feed on the Contact page has been improved
	- Did a better job of structuring and commenting the code
