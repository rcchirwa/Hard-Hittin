This code is part of an on going venture i.e. site creating a Web Application  for an individual in the entertainment industry who agreed for me to open source(place on github) any work related to the site. 

Version 1: The First Waltz (Tag v0.0.1)
-----------------------------------------------

This contains code that was written during my first year of using open source technology to create web applications.  Prior to that, I used proprietary stacks such as one current provided by Oracle. 

The primary noteworthy technologies used here are as follows:


Front End:

	HTML5
	CSS3
	LESS CSS
	JavaScript
	Backbone.js
	Underscore.js
	JQuery
	JSON


Back End:

	Python
	Google App Engine
	Jinja Templating

This is raw code that is not structured and was part of my sandbox aka evolving project. This code was last worked on in October 2012 prior to working a full position that involved Data Engineering and the use of Ruby as a scripting/object-oriented tool. 

The dirty version of the site is currently viewable at the following location: http://www.pranacoding.appspot.com
